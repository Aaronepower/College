This thesis has shown how to build a templating language in Rust. Using extensive research from books such as the \textit{``The Dragon Book''}\cite{DragonBook}, and adapting their core principles into idiomatic Rust code. This thesis has shown the problems of existing templating languages, such as the verboseness of Mustache due to it's need to be usable in any language, and Jade's syntax problem when trying to have layouts, logic, and rich text in a single page. This thesis has shown how \languageName{} address those problems, by removing all forms of explicit logic from the templates, instead moving them to the server's logic.
