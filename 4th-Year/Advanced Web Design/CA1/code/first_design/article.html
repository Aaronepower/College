                        Raqqa, in eastern Syria, has been the headquarters of the Islamic State’s operations in the country since 2013; it is a conquered city, with many civilians who are just trying to keep their heads down. In the past month, every few days has seemed to bring a new round of strikes, followed by a general confusion—about who dropped the bombs, and whether any meaningful target was disabled, or just civilians. A few days ago, just before the San Bernardino attacks escalated the domestic political debate about ISIS, two Beirut-based reporters for the <u><em>Financial Times</em></u> spoke with residents of Raqqa, who told the reporters that they feel, not inaccurately, &ldquo;as if everyone is bombing them at once.&rdquo; They have theories about how a Syrian strike sounds different from a Russian one, and how both sound different from the American or French. A fifty-year-old man, who chose the pseudonym Abu Hadi, recalled watching Islamic State soldiers dragging &ldquo;mangled corpses&rdquo; from the back of their motorcycles, while walking his son to school. He also said that he was more acutely worried about air strikes than about the depravities of the Islamists. &ldquo;If someone looks upwards without an obvious reason, everyone around will be terrified,&rdquo; Abu Hadi said. &ldquo;When there is quiet, you spend all your time thinking, O.K., now a plane is coming.&rdquo; Last week, Russian television showed an image of a circling American drone that had been photographed by a circling Russian drone. It would be a stretch to say that the problem with Raqqa is that it is under-bombed.<br><br>

                        The events of Raqqa hung in the background this weekend, not quite acknowledged, as the Republican Presidential candidates took turns criticizing the White House for complacency against ISIS, and <u>President Obama tried to reassure</u> the nation that the attacks were signs that terrorists were losing, not winning. The tone of foreign-policy debate is always highly allegorical, and in the Republican primary it has been curiously intimate, too, dependent on character: Netanyahu is always Bibi, the Iranians always need a strong talking-to, Munich is always on the mind. The general Republican line on Obama and ISIS has been that, blinded by political correctness, the President hasn’t been willing to draw a clear moral line, to explain that the enemy is radical Islam, or to denounce it as evil. The Republican rhetoric has been blunt and grandiose. &ldquo;<u>The next world war</u>,&rdquo; Chris Christie declared last week. By comparison, the proposals for military action have been surprisingly modest. There has been no sustained call for ground troops. Ted Cruz said he wanted to &ldquo;<u>carpet bomb</u>&rdquo; ISIS &ldquo;into oblivion.&rdquo; We would soon see, he said, &ldquo;if sand can glow.&rdquo; Given what is happening in Raqqa, that did not seem so far from the current approach.<br><br>

                        George Stephanopoulos seemed to pick up on this tension in a television <u>interview</u> with <u>Jeb Bush</u> on Sunday morning. Bush dismissed Cruz’s talk as simplistic (&ldquo;carpet bombing isn’t a strategy,&rdquo; he noted) and detailed the steps he would take: insure the Kurdish militia was sufficiently armed, the Iraqi military better trained, local Sunni leaders engaged, and a no-fly zone established. Stephanopoulos interrupted him to point out that Hillary Clinton shared just about all of those positions. &ldquo;So where are you different on strategy going forward?&rdquo; he asked. Bush said it was impossible to trust that Clinton would deliver on her promises, but Stephanopoulos asked again for specific differences. &ldquo;This is a fight for Western civilization,&rdquo; Bush said, finally. &ldquo;Call it what it is.&rdquo; The distinction Bush wanted was not one of policy but of words.<br><br>

                        A few years ago, you would have expected the Republican argument to turn quickly to proposals for ground troops. But the John McCain wing of the Party has faded. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, its standard-bearer in this election, has become an almost comic figure, jaunty and self-deprecating, invoking coming doom to virtually no audience at all. Bush, whose foreign-policy advisers are drawn from the ranks of his brother’s, had called for American ground troops in Iraq and Syria earlier in the campaign. But now he emphasizes the position less (in his Stephanopoulos interview, he did not mention ground troops), and savvier politicians, such as Marco Rubio and Cruz, have chosen not to raise the possibility. The harsh anti-immigrant line of the primary season; the focus on refugees; <u>Donald Trump’s proposal</u> of a strict religious test for admittance to the country, with Muslims barred—each of these efforts solves the same problem for Republicans. They are ways to insist that you have joined a civilizational struggle, without raising the prospect of actual war.<br><br>

                        The philosophical differences between most of the Republicans and Obama are real; they see the same conflicts as being on different scales. &ldquo;Unlike Rubio, [Obama] considers violent jihadism a small, toxic strain within Islamic civilization, not a civilization itself. And unlike Bush, he doesn’t consider it a serious ideological competitor,&rdquo; <u>Peter Beinart</u> wrote on Monday in The Atlantic. &ldquo;While Republicans think ISIS is strong and growing stronger, Obama thinks it’s weak and growing weaker.&rdquo; When he spoke from the Oval Office on Sunday, Obama argued that ISIS wanted to tempt the West into a land battle, and that the current approach (airstrikes and special forces, to support local troops) was working: &ldquo;They know they can’t defeat us on the battlefield,&rdquo; the President said. Many Republicans seemed to agree. But that left a rhetorical problem: What does a civilizational struggle look like, anyway, if it doesn’t involve a ground war?<br><br>

                        This weekend, it sounded quite a lot like the current war. In an appearance on Fox News, on Sunday night, Rubio called the President &ldquo;<u>completely overwhelmed</u>,&rdquo; but he also suggested policies that broadly echoed the President’s: he wanted more air strikes, and more American special operations soldiers to support local fighters, who he thought needed to be predominantly Sunni to have legitimacy (as does everyone else). It was a more muscular version of Obama’s own strategy. When, on Sunday morning, Bush was pressed for a distinction, he suggested that the White House had been too deferential to the problem of civilian casualties. But in the war on terror Obama has tolerated quite high numbers of civilian deaths: in certain campaigns in Afghanistan, according to leaked documents obtained by <u>The Intercept</u>, the ratio of civilians to combatants killed by drone has been as high as six to one.<br><br>

                        War looks different than it once did. It requires fewer people, and lower costs. There is less need for the same moral summoning, the unruly invocations of patriotism and evil and threat. So much takes place at a lower political amplitude, within the military and intelligence bureaucracies. <u>Obama’s proposed Authorization for Use of Military Force</u> for ISIS has languished in congressional committees for months, as many Republicans have said it is not ambitious enough. &ldquo;The next world war,&rdquo; Christie called the current conflict. But perhaps we will know the next world war not by bold moral declarations that armed hostilities have begun but by the flood of refugees that follow. &ldquo;Call it for what it is,&rdquo; Bush said. The surprise was how close you could get to something that looked like war without many public words at all.<br><br>
