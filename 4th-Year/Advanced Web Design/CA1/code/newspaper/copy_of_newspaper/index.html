                                Red and processed meats should not be treated as an everyday food, according to the Food Safety Authority of Ire- land.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Mary Flynn, chief special- ist in public health nutrition with the authority, stressed the report said there was “only a small risk” of cancer but “defi- nitely high intake, particularly of processed meat, is associat- ed  with colorectal cancer”.<br>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was speaking in res- ponse to the World Health Organisation report which

                             found that eating 50g of processed meat daily inc- reases the risk of colorectal cancer.<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Flynn said processed meat was high in salt and fat and not good for the heart.<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, however, Irish people eat 35g of proc- essed meat a day, the equiv- alent of one and a bit sau- sages, and the report said the risk increased with every 50g extra consumed, equiv- alent to two sau- sages. In some studies the risk inc- reased by 17 per cent and in others by 7 per cent.<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Flynn, a professor at the University of Ulster, said the WHO report was similar to oth-

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said the study des- cribed the link as category one, which meant it had con- vincing evidence.<br>

                However, she said not treat- ing red meat and particu- larly processed meat, as an everyday food had been the authority’s advice for many years.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said meat had natural &ldquo;gem&rdquo; compounds that are good in small doses.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The gem in red meat is its iron content” and women in particular often lack suff- icient iron, impairing cog- nitive function. But “like everything, too much of a good thing is bad for you”.<br>

                omega 3s, which are protect- ive against cancer. Irish peo- ple eat a lot of chicken and there is no link between chi- cken and colon cancer.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people eat fish and chic- ken four or five days a week, it means two or three days for red meat. Dr Flynn said people should also consider vegetarian options on some days.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other reports, this one has not given all the data, she says, but reading between the lines she be- lieves “meat is still a valu- able food, but it is just high consumption” that is prob- lematic.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority’s advice is for 300g of red meat a week: a 100g portion three days a week. “That’s about the size of your palm, without fingers and thumb.”<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be treated as a pleasure and enjoyed, but in small portions and not on a daily basis, she added.<br>

                People should not be alarm- ed. “The risk is among high consumers,” she said. “It’s the people who take a lot of processed meats who you’d like to see take note of this.”<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She urged people to read the authority’s guidelines, parti- cularly pages 10-11 of its publication <em>Healthy Eat- ing and Active Living for Adults and Children over Five Ye- ars</em>, available free on fsai.ie.<br>

                Craft sausage-maker Jane Russell has described the report as “a bit alarmist” for the customer who’s trying to work out what they can and cannot eat.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Russell, whose hand- made sausage business is based in Kilcullen, Co.Kil- dare, said the report was taking quite a blanket app- roach, including fresh meat with processed.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But “it’s a very big thing to say that all processed meats have such a link”.<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We use only fresh pork and don’t use any nitrates in our sausages and use only a single preservative.”<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Russell said she would be “a little bit nervous over the next few weeks” about people’s reactions to the report, but she said their customers were well informed and would buy their sausages because they used only fresh pork.<br>
