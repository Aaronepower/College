# Participant Consent Form
 
The purpose of this usability study is to evaluate the design of a website.  We are interested in determining if people can accomplish common tasks and easily find information using the site. The session will not ‘test' you or your ability, rather the session will test the site to provide information on areas that might be improved. Please be advised that there are no risks associated with participation in this session.

During this session, you will be asked to complete some tasks using the website and answer some questions. As you complete the tasks will be observed and notes will be taken. In addition, the session will be captured on video for future review. The session will last no longer than fifteen minutes.

If for any reason you are uncomfortable during the session and do not want to complete a task, you may say so and we will move on to the next task. In addition, if you do not want to continue, you may end the session and leave at any time.

Approximately 15 people will participate in this study. Results from all sessions will be included in a usability report to be presented to ICON. Your name will not be included in the report nor will your name be associated with any session data collected.

I, ______________________________________________, have read and fully understand the extent of the study and any risks involved. All of my questions, if any, have been answered to my satisfaction. My signature below acknowledges my understanding of the information provided in this form and indicates my willingness to participate in this user testing session.
